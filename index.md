## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is Daniel Akinwale, and I am Senior Undergraduate studying mechanical engineering at Cornell University. On campus I work in the Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering Machine Shop teahching students to use all sorts machining tools for metal, plexiglass, 3D printing. We use laser cutters, CNC machines, water jets, mills, lathes, band saws, and all sorts of other hand tools. I have interned at SRW Engineering & Architecture as a mechanical engineering intern as well as GlobalFoundries as a manufacturing optimization intern.    

I am detail-oriented with knowledge of methods design, process development, and prototyping. I'm eager to lend combined knowledge and skills to enhance business performance. I operate well in both individual and team capacities, leveraging seasoned work ethic to quickly adapt to different processes and drive project objectives. I'm resourceful and results-driven with a passion for growth and efficiency to meet company needs and increase the value of both my projects and myself.
