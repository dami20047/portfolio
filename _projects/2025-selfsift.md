1. Design Phase
In this initial phase, my team conceptualized a novel solution to a common household challenge—cat litter maintenance. We brainstormed a rotating litterbox system that separates waste from clean litter using gravity and mechanical motion. The design prioritizes ease of use, minimal contact with waste, and a clean aesthetic. Key functional features were determined here, including the 180° rotational motion, a grated surface to sift litter, and a removable tray for waste disposal.

2. CAD Modeling Phase
Once the concept was finalized, we transitioned to CAD to bring precision to the ideas. Using Fusion 360, we developed detailed 3D models of each component. The cover image reflects this stage well.

A semi-cylindrical shell acts as the primary containment for the litter.

A perforated  grate inside the shell facilitates litter sifting and doubles as a waste scoop.

A wooden frame supports the rotating drum, with mechanical shafts and bearings allowing for controlled rotation.

The handle and side components were designed for ergonomic waste removal.

This phase allowed for refinement of geometry, tolerances, and mechanical interactions before committing to physical fabrication.

3. Prototyping Phase
With CAD models complete, my team  moved into rapid prototyping. With available tools, this involved 3D printing plastic components like the cylinder, laser-cutting the grate from acrylic, and machining parts to test form and function. Prototypes were evaluated for:

Structural integrity of the rotating mechanism

Fit of the grated tray within the cylindrical body

Ease of assembly/disassembly for cleaning

Effectiveness of litter separation and waste capture

Any design issues found here were  iterated upon back in the CAD phase.

4. Building Phase
After successful prototyping, my team proceeded to build a full-scale, functional model. The final product (as shown in the image) combines wood for structural support, plastic for the cylindrical housing, and a perforated tray designed to trap solid waste. The rotating cylinder appears mounted on an axle supported by custom-cut wooden brackets, with a user-friendly handle enabling manual rotation and waste disposal.

My project is a great example of integrated mechanical design with real-world application. The clean execution and logical sequence from concept to final build demonstrate a solid grasp of engineering fundamentals and product development methodology.
